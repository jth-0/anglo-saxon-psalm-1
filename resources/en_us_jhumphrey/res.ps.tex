Psalm 1
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v1.text}{
Enriched shall be the man who goeth not in the groupthought of the unrightwise
Nor on the way of the sinful standeth
Nor on the woe-bearer's seat sitteth
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v2.text}{
But his will is on God's law, and on his law he thinketh day and night
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v3.text}{
He shall be like a tree that is planted near running waters,
That yields his fruit at the right tide; and his leaf and his blade fall not, neither do they sear. So is the aforementioned man: all his deeds come to good.
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v4.text}{
But the unrightwise are not like that. nor to them does it happen like that,
But he is alike to the dust blowing in the wind.
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v5.text}{
Thus shall the unrightwise not arise on doomsday, nor shall the sinful be in the groupthought of the rightwise,
}
\itId{en}{us}{jhumphrey}{ps}{psa1.v6.text}{
for God knows which way the rightwise have earned, but the unrightwise comes to punishment
}
